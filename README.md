SLStudio -- Structured Light GUI application

This software is designed to enable anyone to implement a custom 3D structured light scanner using a single camera and light projector. It is modular and has a focus on processing speed, enabling real-time structured light capture at 20 Hz and more. When using standard commercial projector and a webcam, the obtainable speed is lower due to the lack of hardware triggering.

When using the software in academic work, please consider citing the following publication.
